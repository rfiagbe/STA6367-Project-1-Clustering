STA6367 (Data Science 2) Project 1 - Cluster Analysis.

Abstract â€” This research offers a thorough comparison of K-
means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algo-
rithms, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across a
range of benchmark datasets. By applying metrics like the
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Infor-
mation (NMI), the study provides valuable insights into how
each algorithm performs with datasets of varying complexities
and structures. For example, while both K-means and GMM
perform well with well-separated clusters, GMM shows a clear
advantage in handling overlapping clusters and unbalanced
data distributions. On the other hand, K-means is particularly
effective in identifying well-defined, distinct groups, making it
ideal for simpler clustering scenarios. This analysis enhances our
understanding of the capabilities of these widely used clustering
techniques and may help inform decisions on selecting the most
appropriate method for tackling complex data analysis tasks
